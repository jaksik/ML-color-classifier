Using TensorFlow JS and a data set of rgb values with color labels to train a model to guess the name of a color created by the user.

When the page first loads, use the R/G/B sliders to create your custom color.
Notice how the computer's prediction is far from accurate.
Then hit the "Train Model" button.
You will notice that the computer's prediction gradually improves in accuracy.
The model is programmed to train for 10 epochs, which will take about one minute to complete.
When finished training the accuracy is near 100%.
