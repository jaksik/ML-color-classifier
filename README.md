# Machine Learning Color Classifier
### Built with TensorFlow JS

[Demo The App](https://jaksik.github.io/html-ml-classifier/)

## How It Works
1. After the user clicks the "Train and Predict" button, the application will begin training on a data set of over 5,000 random RGB values each associated with 1 of 9 different colors (Red, Green, Blue, Orange, Yello, Pink, Purple, Brown, Grey). 
**The data entries look like this**
```javascript
 {
      "b": 155,
      "g": 183,
      "r": 81,
      "label": "green-ish",
  },
```
2. Using the slider inputs, the user can then generate their own unique color which will be displayed on the canvas.

3. The application will automatically try to label the color generated by the user. The application is pre-set to train for 10 epochs which takes roughly one minute to complete. Notice how the application gradually becomes much more accurate over the course of a minute.
