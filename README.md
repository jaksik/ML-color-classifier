A "Hello World" app using Tensorflow JS to train a model to predict a specified color.
When the page is loaded the model automatically starts training its self to associate a color name with certain RGB values.
It is constantly trying to predict the color chosen by the user on the canvas.
The color names on the screen are the programs predictions of the color on the canvas.
Notice that after 30 seconds to a minute the computers predictions begin to be much more accurate.
